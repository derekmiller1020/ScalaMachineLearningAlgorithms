Simplified Machine Learning Algorithms in Scala


As time goes on, I plan to add some (hopefully) simplified machine learning algorithms here in Scala.

Most of these were found in various places online, and altered/translated to scala.

These are here for educational purposes, and I hope to comment each of the methods for 
full explanations of each of the algorithms.

Most of these implementations were derived from Joel Grus' book, Data Science from scratch.
